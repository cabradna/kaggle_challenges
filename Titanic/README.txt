# Titanic Machine Learning Kaggle Competition

## Overview
This repository contains my notebook solution for the Titanic machine learning competition on Kaggle. The goal of the competition is to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic based on various features such as age, sex, class, etc.

## Files
- `notebook.ipynb`: The Jupyter notebook containing the complete solution, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
- `README.txt`: This file, providing an overview of the project and instructions for running the code.

## Requirements
To run the notebook, you will need the following Python packages:
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

You can install the required packages using pip:
```sh
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/titanic-competition.git
cd titanic-competition
```

2. Open the Jupyter notebook:
```sh
jupyter notebook notebook.ipynb
```

3. Run the cells in the notebook to execute the code step-by-step.

## Solution Outline
1. **Data Loading**: Load the Titanic dataset and perform initial exploration.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features to improve model performance.
4. **Model Training**: Train a RandomForestClassifier using GridSearchCV to find the best hyperparameters.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance using cross-validation and test data.
6. **Prediction**: Generate predictions for the test set and save the results to a CSV file.

## Results
The final model achieved an accuracy of XX% on the test set. The predictions are saved in `jul24cv_sub.csv`.
