# Titanic Machine Learning Kaggle Competition

## Overview
This repository contains my notebook solution for the Titanic machine learning competition on Kaggle. The goal of the competition is to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic based on various features such as age, sex, class, etc.

## Files
- `random-forest-cross-validation-submission.ipynb`: The Jupyter notebook containing the complete solution, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
- `README.txt`: This file, providing an overview of the project and instructions for running the code.

## Requirements
To run the notebook, you will need the following Python packages:
- numpy
- pandas
- seaborn
- plotly
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

You can install the required packages using pip:
```sh
pip install numpy pandas seaborn plotly matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/cabradna/kaggle_challenges
cd Titanic
```

2. Open the Jupyter notebook:
```sh
jupyter notebook random-forest-cross-validation-submission.ipynb
```

3. Run the cells in the notebook to execute the code step-by-step.

## Solution Outline
1. **Overview**: Introduction to the project and its objectives.
2. **Exploring Variables**: Visualize and analyze the data using heat maps and histograms.
3. **Data Processing**: Perform data preprocessing, including a stratified split of the dataset.
4. **Modeling**: Train models using cross-validation and grid search on the test set.
5. **Building Final Model**: Conduct cross-validation and grid search on the entire dataset to build the final model.
6. **Final Prediction**: Generate final predictions and save the results to a CSV file.
